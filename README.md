# Diabetes-Disease-Prediction

Diabetes is a prevalent chronic medical condition affecting millions of people worldwide. The accurate
categorization and classification of diabetes into its various types, such as Type 1, Type 2, and gestational diabetes,
are crucial for effective patient management and treatment planning. However, manual classification can be time-
consuming and subject to errors. Therefore, there is a need for an automated system that can categorize diabetes
cases accurately and efficiently.
Diabetes can cause blood sugar levels to rise if it is not continuously and carefully managed, which raises the
chance of serious side effects like heart attack and stroke. To address this problem, we aim to predict the likelihood
of a person having diabetes using a Python Machine Learning Algorithm. We will gather data on various factors
such as blood pressure, sugar levels, and other relevant variables.


Goal:

• Predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes using data on blood pressure, sugar levels, and other
variables.

• Identify the most indicative features of diabetes.

• Evaluate and compare different classification methods to find the highest accuracy.


Objectives:
• Gather and analyze data on people's blood pressure, sugar levels, and other relevant variables.
• Develop a Python Machine Learning Algorithm to predict the likelihood of diabetes.
• Evaluate the performance of different classification models and select the most accurate one.


Success Criteria:
• The dataset used for training and testing the model will be sourced from reputable health organizations to
ensure inclusivity and representation across different ethnic backgrounds and age groups.
• The model's success will be measured by evaluating its performance using appropriate metrics such as
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
• The model should demonstrate high accuracy in predicting diabetes status and identify the most important
features contributing to the prediction.
• The project's success will be determined by its practical usefulness in the pharmaceutical field, where it can
assist in diagnosing diabetes using readily available data.
Assumptions, Risks, Obstacles:
• It is assumed that the data obtained from health organizations is accurate and representative of the target
population.
• To mitigate bias, efforts will be made to ensure the dataset used for training and testing is diverse and inclusive,
covering different ethnic backgrounds and age groups.
• Real-time data access will be sought to ensure the model can adapt to changing patterns and maintain its accuracy
over time.
